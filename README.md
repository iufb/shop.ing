### Project Overview

This project is a web application designed to resemble a shop. It utilizes a Python script as its backend. For the frontend, I opted to use the Next.js framework and Next.js API calls to fetch and display data. To enhance the user experience, I incorporated the Framer Motion library, which provides seamless appearance animations and interactive cursor animations.
